Comics App
Description
Using the Marvel developer API ​https://developer.marvel.com/​, create a simple app that allows the user to scroll through all the comics ever released from the most recent to the oldest (and please, let us see the cover picture while at it!). The app should allow users to search by character (eg. ​deadpool​) and allow the user to mark specific comics as favourites.
The assets to recreate the design can be found inside the `assets` folder. The Marvel API interactive documentation can be found here:
https://developer.marvel.com/docs
For the purpose of this task, use the following keys:
MARVEL_PUBLIC_KEY=07e3e205bebd46de31d15ee9a76d85c2 MARVEL_PRIVATE_KEY=cb116416e7b6451df4226e110970d61e15dcf22f
Requirements:
1. When I open the page I want to see a list of all Marvel’s released comic books covers ordered from most recent to the oldest
2. When I see the list of comics I want to be able to search by character (eg. ​“deadpool”​) so I can find my favorite comics
3. When I see the list of comics I want to be able to upvote any of them so that the most popular are easy to find in the future

Implementation Notes
● Acceptable implementation languages are Ruby and Javascript. You may use any language framework readily available to you (using Rails is encouraged!)
● Completed projects must include a README with enough instructions for evaluators to build and run the code
● Use appropriate production-capable frameworks
● Use appropriate dependency-management and build tools
● The project's structure and organization should follow best practices
● Prefer immutable design if possible
● Test your code and your API. No need to test every permutation, but demonstrate you
know the types of things to test for.
● Even though this is a simplified requirement as appropriate to be an exercise, your code
should be production capable
● Assume the application will be used by a reasonable number of users, external API rate
limiting may be applied
● User management and authentication is not required, a 30 minute cookie based session
is sufficient
● Show your working, if you've used any interesting libraries or approaches during
development let us know and explain why in the README
